Lecture 1: Introduction and Peak Finding
Lecture Overview
•	 Administrivia
•	 Course Overview
•	 “Peak finding” problem — 1D and 2D versions
Course Overview
This course covers:
•	 Efficient procedures for solving problems on large inputs (Ex: U.S. Highway Map,
Human Genome)
•	 Scalability
•	 Classic data structures and elementary algorithms (CLRS text)
•	 Real implementations in Python
•	 Fun problem sets!
The course is divided into 8 modules — each of which has a motivating problem and problem
set(s) (except for the last module). Tentative module topics and motivating problems are
as described below:
1. Algorithmic Thinking: Peak Finding
2. Sorting & Trees: Event Simulation
3. Hashing: Genome Comparison
4. Numerics: RSA Encryption
5. Graphs: Rubik’s Cube
6. Shortest Paths: Caltech → MIT
7. Dynamic Programming: Image Compression
8. Advanced Topics
